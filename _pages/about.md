I am fifth year applied physics PhD student at the [Colorado School of Mines](physics.mines.edu). My thesis focuses on the design of tunable couplers for 2D and 3D superconducting circuits for quantum computing. Other areas of research include materials losses in superconducting resonators and 3D cavities as metrological tools.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing the front range and four corners area,
read, and listen to attempt to play jazz and other genres on various musical
instruments.
