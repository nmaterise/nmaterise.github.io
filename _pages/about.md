I am a fifth year applied physics PhD student at the [Colorado School of Mines](https://mines.edu) advised by [Eliot Kapit](https://physics.mines.edu/project/kapit-group). My thesis focuses on the design of tunable couplers for 2D and 3D superconducting circuits for quantum computing.

Other areas of research include experimental determination of materials losses in superconducting resonators, modeling time-correlated noise in superconducting circuits, and using 3D cavities in materials loss experiments.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, and listening to and playing
jazz on various musical instruments.
